# Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Python

In this analysis Python is used to wrangle and analyze several datasets for Instacart. And created a report that communicates the analysis process and results and recommendations to key business questions from Instacart.

## **Project Summary**

This repository contains an initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart's sales data, with a focus on uncovering customer purchasing patterns. As an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery platform, the objective is to derive insights that will inform a targeted marketing strategy. The analysis explores the variety of customers in the database and their buying behaviors, aiming to identify distinct customer segments. These insights will help Instacart tailor its marketing campaigns to effectively reach and influence the right customer profiles, ultimately optimizing product sales.
